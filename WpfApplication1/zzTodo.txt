Some cryptic remarks

* Known Bugs:
- If very large files are copied UI hangs, make different background process

- Errors that could not be traced yet, not reproducable and frequently seen:
  - New Folder/move/copy to current application folder, seems empty string. 
  - One problem with Rename. Check if existing file?
  - deal with no access to folder?? 

Minor, can be fixed:  
- Folderplane. If other tab selected, on return selection reset and Datagrid sort options back to default. 
  Can we store that per tab??
- Folderplane on creation not in focus for example for Cntrl+A.
- Once SavedTab item selected, click again does not result in action. Button + command trick?

** Improve looks
  Allow more styling. 
  Improve Buttons. Program Icon.
  Tabs NavTree in list without border, popup when in area
  Tabs FolderPlanes more animation
  
* NavTreeTabs
Functional
- Favorites. Find documentation, or: construct own Favorites tree in own folder.
- History. Frequenties/Recent. FolderTabs in an TabNavTree
- Libraries etc.
- Show in a NavTreeTab the expanded tree of the current selected Tab 
Visual
- Icons for RootItems TabbedNavTree, try tabs only icons, items vertical in left border or:
- Tabs just List of items, can popup if mouse in area
- One tree including all rootitems, easy collapse command
- Switch as in Nortan Commander TabbedNavTrees <-> FolderPlane.
- NavTreeTabs as popup, just as SavedFolderTabs

* Tabs FolderPlanes. Try:
- More like filmstrip
- Text one line, max width dep on hover,selected
- Vertical tabs limited width, pop up on hover/selected
- Try thin slider
- Move them to TabbedNavTrees
- Nice border on hover, on selected nice color

- Control key + folder up or folderdown: use new folderplane Tab, do not use current 
- Scroll by mousedown and drag
- Change name tab

* SavedFolderplaneTabs try small circles/radiobutton with tooltip/on selection. 
- Cntrl+click button = add, keep current Tabs
- More easy management. Now Open Tabs (add, close, extra tabs, sort), delete and new save  

* FileManagement
- Mark snapshot files with special color<> selected
- Feedback on double items, choices, errors
- Use background process or Async 
- Refresch using FileSystemWatcher expanded items
- Allow Filemanagement buttons also on single selected NavTrees /Items
- Drag/Drop between selected items -> Tab, Tab -> Tab (==sort Tabs), Tab -> current (== Move Folder)
- Drag/Drop from/to Snapshot
- Introduce a Source. Drag/drop from source
- Visual Feedback Snapshot

* Drag Drop (see also other items)
- Allow dragging (incl. cntrl key) from items open FolderTab to other Tab
- Allow drag/drop from/to outside application/windows
- A Drag and Drop framework needed, uppon dragging several drag options open, must resolve to one on dropping 
- Drag/Drop to/from Snapshot, SourceFolder

Note: when dragging grid selection gets messed. Probably because on LeftMouseDown selected items gets reset.
Does it help to do action in MousesPreviewdown (tunnel. bubble), prevent LeftMouseDown

* History
 - Global, Per Tab
 - History buttons for current FolderTab
 - Adressbar W7 alike (up, back, all tabs). 
 
* FileInfo
  Button, context menu

* Refactor/Refine
  Make general (user)contols. 
  Split lines algorithm: force split long items
  IOC, Services, Messaging system, weak references
